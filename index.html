                <p>Dutch Apple Pie has a Streseul top. Streseul is way better than plain old crust. Mostly all good Dutch pie shops are really just a cafe with forced outside seating. This is nice, because you typically order inside and you can make things appear like you're ordering for three people, when in reality you just intend to eat three pieces of pie.'</p>

            <p>It's like a Septa Key Card, except it's good for everything - you get to a place and there's a ferry, you know you can just hop on. Trolly, train, bike-share. Makes life easy and you can just rely on Google Maps and pretened you know where you're going.'</p>

            <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Fudge and a Hershey bar are kinda the same thing, I guess - that's what Chocomel vs Chocolate Milk is like. They're basically the same thing - but not comparable at all.</p>

            <p>It's melted cheese that's socially acceptable to eat and you can get it everywhere. We need to adopt this.
